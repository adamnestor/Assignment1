                <p>Patented Technology</p>
                <p>Brain.fm holds patents on key processes for creating functional music, including technology to elicit <span style="font-weight: bold;">strong neural phase locking</span>-allowing populations of neurons to engage in various kinds of coordinated activity-and technology to remove distraction in sound.</p>
                <p>This makes our music unique, purpose-built to steer you into a desire mental state. In other words, we've found new ways to create music that helps you do what you need to do.</p>

                <p>Tested on Brain and Behavior</p>
                <p>Scientists at Brain.fm work with collaborators at academic instituations to run experiments.</p>
                <p>We look at the effects of our technology on the brain, using fMRI and EEG, and also run large-scale behavioral tests, measuring performance on simple games.</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Our experiments always include a control condition ('placebo')</span> of the same underlying music without Brain.fm technology applied, so we can be sure our tech is what makes the difference.</p>
